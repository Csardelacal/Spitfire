What is the /bin folder?

Historically, applications would place compiled versions of their applications in
a bin folder, which stands for binary. Obviously, PHP does not generate binaries.

Instead, Spitfire uses the bin folder to place components of your application that
are built in a development environment and even, in some cases, committed to the 
repository.

The bin folder is private, it contains no resources, and it is not advisable to
scan it for usable classes or similar. It contains a single bootstrap script that
includes a series of files that are necessary for the application to work.
