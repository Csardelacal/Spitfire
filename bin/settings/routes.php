/* Use this file to add routes to your Spitfire app. Just use them like this
 *
 * router::route('/old/url', '/new/url');
 *
 * Or like this
 * 
 * router:route('old/url/*', 'new/$2/url');
 * 
 * Remember that routes are blocking. If one matches it'll stop the execution
 * of the following rules. So add them wisely.
 * It's really easy and fun!
