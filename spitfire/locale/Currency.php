/**
 * Contains information that is locale safe about a currency, including the 
 * preferred symbol, ISO Code and decimal number count.
 * 
 * Please note that the use of this class does not replace common pitfalls that 
 * may arise and require additional handling on the application's end.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * * This class does not manage the position of the symbol, wherever your locale
 *   may prefer to have the symbol depends on the locale itself.
 * 
 * * This class does not manage localization across different locales, for example,
 *   the dollar symbol is used by several regions in which the US$ is printed as
 *   "USD"
