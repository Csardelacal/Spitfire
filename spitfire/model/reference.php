 * Elements of this class indicate a connection between two Models, this allows
 * spitfire to let you use relational databases just like they were objects
 * (connected to each other). While real elements are scattered around tables
 * in no apparent manner.
 * 
 * This class doesn't indicate how the fields inside objects relate as their
 * names are automatically inherited by the source model when referencing. Names
 * for the fields are always given in a <i>alias</i>_<i>srcfield</i> fashion to 
 * improve understanding.
 * 
 * [NOTICE] The model doesn't check for the availability of field names, in case
 * you have duplicate field names due to references the system may behave in an 
 * unexpected way.
