 * sanitize user data and prepare information from the DB in a way that it's user
 * friendly.
 * 
 * The adapter can also set and receive virtual data, allowing it to hold information
 * that is not present / stored to the database. I.e. This is useful for arrays,
 * which are not contained as that in the database.
 * 
 * An array can either be stored in a serialized manner (which would require the
 * adapter to serialize / unserialize it every time) or as a child field, in which
 * case you can store several records that 'belong' to the parent record but are
 * stored in different tables.
