/**
 * An uplink is an element that defines a relation between two database
 * queries. This is useful when we create a complex restriction and need to 
 * create a set of restrictions that connect the tables.
 * 
 * Every uplink is defined by two queries being connected and a reference
 * that defines what field is used to connect them and allows us to check what 
 * relation exists between them.
 * 
 * This class is a helper that removes the need to create loops through the 
 * physical fields of a restriction and generate clean code in the calling methods.
 * 
 * For readability, encapsulation and code cleanness the only type of connecting 
 * field accpeted is actually a reference. This forces the code that uses uplinks
 * to convert the other types to References and use those.
