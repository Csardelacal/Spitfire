/**
 * An ancestor is an element that defines a descending relation between two 
 * database tables. This is important when two Models / Tables are connected in
 * several ways.
 * 
 * Every ancestor is defined by the Record that holds information about it and
 * the reference that allows us to check what relation exists between them.
 * 
 * Ancestors are best explained with the example their named after, parents. 
 * A baby descends from a father and a mother. The baby's relation to his father 
 * is 'father' and the relation to his mother, 'mother'. Opposed to this, the
 * baby is a 'child' of father and mother so the relation offers no information
 * in the opposite way.
 * 
 * In our example the Ancestor class contains the father and the relation 'father'
 * so we can retrieve the baby by looking for babies whose father is our ancestor.
 * Obviously this is not a perfect example, as no person can be a father and a 
 * mother at the same time. A better example would be a car inssurance were the
 * one who pays the insurance and the driver are not always the same person.
